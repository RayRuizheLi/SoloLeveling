Basic goal system

- Repetative goal
    - Do x y amount of times
    - Spawn same ticket when one is completed 
    - Individual tickets are stored in the same table as Todo 
    - Each repeatative goal is stored in the goals table
    - Count by checking how many tickets have the same title
    - Shows progress indicator [====-----]
    - Goal should have a starting time and end time. 

- Goals with different milestones 
    - Do a then do b then do c 
    - Setup prompts user to input all the different goals all at once. 
    - Milestones should start with a number
    - Each milestone is a ticket and is stored in the todo list
    - The milestone itself is stored on the goals list
        - Should store a tag that indicates which tickets belong to this goal 
        - Should store a list of ticket names. When finish a ticket, pop the first name, and make the next ticket available. 
            - Hide ticket through a "visible" tag
    - goal should have a starting time and end time 
    - Maybe we can make this as a infinite tree stucture  

New fields in the todo list:
start date, end date, goal tag, reward tag, visibility

New Goals list: 
ID, start date, end date, title, name of tickets, total count, completed count

How does the goal controller work?
- User chooses between a repeat goal or milestones
- User creates a goal and specify the amount of repeat
    - goal controller creates the first ticket. 
    - When a ticket is completed, the todo controller checks if there is a goal tag.
    - It prompts the goal_controller to update progress and create the next ticket in todo. 
- User creates a milestones and a create ticket prompt appears
    - User can continue to create more milestones until the user stops
        - Each milestone is added by the todo controller as a normal ticket except visibility off. 
        - Each milestone ticket name is created and stored in the milestones ticket seperated by a comma. 
    - When a ticket is completed, the todo controller checks if there is a goal tag.
    - It prompts the goal_controller to update progress and turn the next ticket's visibility to true
        - We know the ticket is the same ticket by ticket name + goal tag 
- Uses [===----] to indicate the progress 
- Show due date and if needed
