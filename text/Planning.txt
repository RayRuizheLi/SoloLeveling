Basic goal system

- Repetative goal
    - Do x y amount of times
    - Spawn same ticket when one is completed 
    - Individual tickets are stored in the same table as Todo 
    - Each repeatative goal is stored in the goals table
    - Count by checking how many tickets have the same title
    - Shows progress indicator [====-----]
    - Goal should have a starting time and end time. 
    - Hide ticket by a 'visibility' tag

- Goals with different milestones 
    - Do a then do b then do c 
    - Setup prompts user to input all the different goals all at once. 
    - Milestones should start with a number
    - Each milestone is a ticket and is stored in the todo list
    - The milestone itself is stored on the goals list
        - Should store a tag that indicates which tickets belong to this goal 
        - Should store a list of ticket names. When finish a ticket, pop the first name, and make the next ticket available. 
            - Hide ticket through a "visible" tag
    - goal should have a starting time and end time 
    - Maybe we can make this as a infinite tree stucture
