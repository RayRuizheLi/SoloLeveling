Todo list for creating a multi-listing ticketing system:

- We will have different types of tickets such as work, normal, on the same table, seperated by a tag. 
    - User can list all the different tags and pick which tag they would like to see 
- We will have repetative habbits (which I would like to call weekly goals in a new table) (this will be combined with dailies)
- We will also have rewards on a new table.
